This repo contains my notes extracted from various articles and papers

## A Definition of this new architectural term
The term "Microservice Architecture" has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing applications as suites of indipendently deployable services. In other words, the microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API. There is a bare minimum of centralized management of these services, which may be written in different programming languages and use different data storage technologies.
